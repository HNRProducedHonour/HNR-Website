				<h1>About Us</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="article column1">
				<h2>How we started</h2>
				<p>It was a summer term and we were all bored of not having enough money to pay for things. 
					So my friend decided we needed to make a change. I started creating a website saving up
				money for a domain
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column2">
				<h2>Why we did this?</h2>
				<p>We are a bunch of regular schoolboys tryna make some passive income for some extra cash 
					for the future of our lifes. We knew it was going to be hard as only a small group 
					wanted to help. <br>
					It will pay off in the end.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="article column3">
				<h2>How to donate?</h2>
				<p>You can donate by giving a tip at checkout.<br><br>
				It will be greatly appreciated by the group.<br><br>
				Thanks for taking your time to read this.<br>
